This file is for instructions on making a pass through tile.

To start with, create new tilemap node.
== create a seperate tileset.
  -- When creating the tileset, do not outline collisions. It will be handled elsewhere.

Once the tileset is complete and saved, add a StaticBody2D child to the newly formed tilemap.
The placement of this StaticBody2D does not matter. Next add a CollisionShape2D as a child of the StaticBody2D and give it a rectangle shape.


At this point you should currently have a structure like this.


-- New_Tilemap
    -- StaticBody2D
        -- CollisionShape2D



You can move the CollisionShape2D to the area you want to only be a one way tile. So you can jump through the bottom but the top will not let you fall through.

 --- For help with lining the collisions up.
     You want to show the grid and set the grid size to match your tile sizes.

     There is a picture in this folder labeled "One Way Helper Image"
      -- Inside that is a picture with 2 buttons highlighted. The button that has what looks like a ruler in it is grid snapping. This will show you the grid.
      -- The one that looks like 3 dots, is a menu. Here is where you adjust the size of the grid to match your tiles.
          -- Click the 3 buttons and then click the "Configure Snap" from the options that appear.
              -- Inside the "Configure Snap" menu, change the grid step to what it should be. For example, if the tiles are 64px, then set both Grid Steps to 32px each.
              -- Then change the "Primary Line Every" option to 1 step instead of 8.

-- Lastly, when selecting the CollisionShape2D from the node tree on the left, mark the option "One Way Collision" for every one of the CollisionShape2D's. This is what gives it the functionality.

--- You can stack multipe CollisionShape2D's under that one StaticBody2D. Then move each CollisionShape2D to where ever you need it.





A Finished Scene Example Might Look Like This.


--- New Tile Map
    --- StaticBody2D
        -- CollisionShape2D
        -- CollisionShape2D
        -- CollisionShape2D
        -- CollisionShape2D
