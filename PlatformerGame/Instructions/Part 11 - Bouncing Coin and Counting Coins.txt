To start with, open the Coin scene and add a "Animation Player" node.

-- When you add the "Animation Player", if you select that node in the node tree, in the bottom of the screen where a print statement will output, there is now a dropdown box that says animation. If you click that
It will give you a popup menu with options to save, load, edit etc..

-- Click "New"
-- Name it "Bounce"
-- After creating this, it will now show a keyframe option in the animation window at the bottom of the screen.


-- Next we are going to select what we want to animate with the Animation Player.
-- Select the Animated Sprite node. As this is what we will be animating.
-- In the bottom of the screen by the debugger, you will see a tab labeled "Animation" be sure this is selected.

-- After doing so, you will see little keys next to properties in the inspector area of the Animated Sprite
-- You can select a key to use to animate based off that property. 
-- Select the position key in the Transform area of the Inspector.


-- Every time that property changes to your desired liking, hit the key button again next to the property. (Remember to have the animation area selected)
